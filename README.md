# Terraform-Provisioner

We can use the provisioner whenever we are trying to create the resources they will not run once the resources are created.

* local-exec : Executes commands locally on the machine running Terraform, rather than on the resource itself.

* remote-exec : remote servers. For this we need to make first connection and then we can install or update configuration changes to the server if required .
